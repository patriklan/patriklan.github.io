                <h3>Microphones</h3>
                <h3>Microphone types</h3>
                <p>The three microphone types are dynamic, condenser  and ribbon. All of these function differently but for the most part give similar sounding results.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Dynamic microphones</span> are the simplest of the bunch. They are the most durable and cheapest too so they are often used for stage performances as well as in recording studios. Some examples you might be familiar with are the Shure SM58 and SM57 as well as the Shure SM7B. (Do not take these as recommendations, they are merely examples.)</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Condenser microphones</span> are most commonly used for recording vocals and instruments, they’re often found in recording studios. In most cases, they can pick up a wider frequency range than dynamic microphones and their frequency response is usually more neutral. They also require additional power called phantom power, usually it’s 48v. Phantom power will be supplied by your audio interface or mixer. Some examples of condenser microphones you might be familiar with are the Neumann U87, Neumann TLM-103, Rode NT-1A and Audio Technica AT2020. (Again these are examples, not recommendations.)</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Ribbon microphones</span> as the name implies use a ribbon to pick up sound. They are the oldest type and not used as much as condensers and dynamics. Some people still use them for their unique sound. They most commonly have the bidirectional or figure-8 polar pattern.</p>
                <h3>Polar patterns</h3>
                <p>A microphone’s polar or pickup pattern tells us from which directions a microphone will pick up sound. These include: cardioid, supercardioid, hypercardioid, subcardioid, omnidirectional, bidirectional AKA figure-8 and shotgun.</p>

                <h3>Audio interfaces</h3>
                <p>The most basic explanation of what an audio interface is that it’s a device which converts the signal your microphone outputs into something that can be sent to your computer.</p>
                <p>An audio interface includes a <span class="bold">preamplifier</span> and an analog to digital converter (<span class="bold">ADC</span>).</p>
                <p>The signal microphones output is very weak and needs to be boosted by a preamplifier. That same signal is analog and computers don’t understand analog so the ADC is needed.</p>
                <p>Of course microphones aren’t the only thing we can use as inputs, we also have instruments and line inputs. For the microphone inputs interfaces will have an XLR connector and for line and instrument inputs it will usually be a 1/4" (6.35mm) input. Read more about the microphone, line and instrument level signals in the <a href="#connectors-signals">connectors and signals</a> guide.</p>
                <p>Interfaces also feature outputs for speakers and headphones. Since we are outputting a signal we need to convert it into an analog one this time. That’s what we use a <span class="bold">DAC</span> (digital to analog converter) for. Headphones and speakers need an amplifier to be able to reproduce the signal. Interfaces feature a headphone amp but not a speaker one, as those require much more power. You can use active speakers or connect a speaker amp to your interface (the latter applies to headphones too).</p>
                <p>Monitoring your inputs is something most interfaces allow you to do. They take the signal being fed into the inputs and directly send it to the outputs, that’s why it’s called <span class="bold">direct monitoring</span>.</p>
                <p>The interface will allow you to select how much you’re boosting the signal with <span class="bold">gain</span> knobs.</p>

                <h3>Microphones</h3>
                <p>Behringer XM8500, Behringer SL 85S, Behringer BA 85A</p>
                <p>If you want to chat with your friends or make some decent sounding recordings these are some good cheap microphones you could get.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Behringer C-1</p>
                <p>A good sounding cheap condenser microphone.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Above microphones will fit most people’s use cases and will sound good enough, however here is a longer list of microphones: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Behringer C-3 (basically a C-1 with multiple polar patterns)</li>
                    <li>Behringer B-1</li>
                    <li>Behringer C-2 (SDC)</li>
                    <li>MXL V67G</li>
                    <li>MXL 770</li>
                    <li>MXL 990</li>
                    <li>sE 7 (SDC)</li>

                    <li>sE X1S</li>
                    <li>sE DynaCaster</li>
                    <li>Stellar X2</li>
                    <li>sE 2200</li>

                    <li>Rode NT1000</li>
                    <li>Rode K2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since live use cases require microphones which are durable, have good feedback rejection and of course sound nice consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>sE V7</li>
                    <li>Sennheiser E 965</li>
                    <li>Shure Beta 87A</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Audio interfaces</h3>
                <p>Before buying an audio interface it is important to know what exactly you need. First learn what an audio interface is in the <a href="#recording">Introduction to microphones and recording equipment</a> guide.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some of the questions you should ask yourself before deciding on an interface:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How many microphone, instrument and line inputs do you need?</li>
                    <li>How many headphone and speaker outputs do you need?</li>
                    <li>Do you need any additional features? (software, onboard DSP…)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>List of audio interfaces:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Behringer UM2</li>
                    <li>Behringer UMC22</li>
                    <li>Behringer UMC202HD</li>
                    <li>Behringer UMC204HD</li>
                    <li>Behringer UMC404HD</li>
                    <li>Behringer UMC1820</li>
                    <li>M-Audio M-Track Solo</li>
                    <li>M-Audio M-Track Duo</li>
                    <li>Arturia MiniFuse 1, MiniFuse 2, MiniFuse 4</li>
                    <li>Motu M2, M4, M6</li>
                    <li>Motu UltraLite mk5</li>
                    <li>Audient iD4, iD14, iD24, iD44</li>
                    <li>RME Fireface UCX, Fireface UFX</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember that you need an XLR cable to connect your microphone to an audio interface.</p>
                <p>Unless you want to hold your microphone in your hand you should get a floor stand or a scissor arm that attaches to your desk. Stands that sit on your desk are not recommended as they can send vibrations from your desk to the microphone.</p>
                <p>Windscreens and pop filters are recommended to avoid plosives, however with a proper microphone technique you can reduce plosives without those.
