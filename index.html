                <h3>Microphones</h3>
                <h3>Microphone types</h3>
                <p>The three microphone types are dynamic, condenser  and ribbon. All of these function differently but for the most part give similar sounding results.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Dynamic microphones</span> are the simplest of the bunch. They are the most durable and cheapest too so they are often used for stage performances as well as in recording studios. Some examples you might be familiar with are the Shure SM58 and SM57 as well as the Shure SM7B. (Do not take these as recommendations, they are merely examples.)</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Condenser microphones</span> are most commonly used for recording vocals and instruments, they’re often found in recording studios. In most cases, they can pick up a wider frequency range than dynamic microphones and their frequency response is usually more neutral. They also require additional power called phantom power, usually it’s 48v. Phantom power will be supplied by your audio interface or mixer. Some examples of condenser microphones you might be familiar with are the Neumann U87, Neumann TLM-103, Rode NT-1A and Audio Technica AT2020. (Again these are examples, not recommendations.)</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Ribbon microphones</span> as the name implies use a ribbon to pick up sound. They are the oldest type and not used as much as condensers and dynamics. Some people still use them for their unique sound. They most commonly have the bidirectional or figure8 polar pattern.</p>
                <h3>Polar patterns</h3>
                <p>A microphone’s polar or pickup pattern tells us from which directions a microphone will pick up sound. These include: cardioid, supercardioid, hypercardioid, subcardioid, omnidirectional, bidirectional AKA figure-8 and shotgun.</p>
