    <title>Introduction To Microphones And Recording Equipment</title>

    <h2>Introduction to microphones and recording equipment</h2>
                <h3>Microphones</h3>
                <h3>Microphone types</h3>
                <p>The three microphone types are dynamic, condenser  and ribbon. All of these function differently but for the most part give similar sounding results.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Dynamic microphones</span> are the simplest of the bunch. They are the most durable and cheapest too so they are often used for stage performances as well as in recording studios. Some examples you might be familiar with are the Shure SM58 and SM57 as well as the Shure SM7B. (Do not take these as recommendations, they are merely examples.)</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Condenser microphones</span> are most commonly used for recording vocals and instruments, they’re often found in recording studios. In most cases, they can pick up a wider frequency range than dynamic microphones and their frequency response is usually more neutral. They also require additional power called phantom power, usually it’s 48v. Phantom power will be supplied by your audio interface or mixer. Some examples of condenser microphones you might be familiar with are the Neumann U87, Neumann TLM-103, Rode NT-1A and Audio Technica AT2020. (Again these are examples, not recommendations.)</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Ribbon microphones</span> as the name implies use a ribbon to pick up sound. They are the oldest type and not used as much as condensers and dynamics. Some people still use them for their unique sound. They most commonly have the bidirectional or figure-8 polar pattern.</p>
                <h3>Polar patterns</h3>
                <p>A microphone’s polar or pickup pattern tells us from which directions a microphone will pick up sound. These include: cardioid, supercardioid, hypercardioid, subcardioid, omnidirectional, bidirectional AKA figure-8 and shotgun.</p>

                <h3>Audio interfaces</h3>
                <p>The most basic explanation of what an audio interface is that it’s a device which converts the signal your microphone outputs into something that can be sent to your computer.</p>
                <p>An audio interface includes a <span class="bold">preamplifier</span> and an analog to digital converter (<span class="bold">ADC</span>).</p>
                <p>The signal microphones output is very weak and needs to be boosted by a preamplifier. That same signal is analog and computers don’t understand analog so the ADC is needed.</p>
                <p>Of course microphones aren’t the only thing we can use as inputs, we also have instruments and line inputs. For the microphone inputs interfaces will have an XLR connector and for line and instrument inputs it will usually be a 1/4" (6.35mm) input. Read more about the microphone, line and instrument level signals in the <a href="connectors-and-signals.html">connectors and signals</a> guide.</p>
                <p>Interfaces also feature outputs for speakers and headphones. Since we are outputting a signal we need to convert it into an analog one this time. That’s what we use a <span class="bold">DAC</span> (digital to analog converter) for. Headphones and speakers need an amplifier to be able to reproduce the signal. Interfaces feature a headphone amp but not a speaker one, as those require much more power. You can use active speakers or connect a speaker amp to your interface (the latter applies to headphones too).</p>
                <p>Monitoring your inputs is something most interfaces allow you to do. They take the signal being fed into the inputs and directly send it to the outputs, that’s why it’s called <span class="bold">direct monitoring</span>.</p>
                <p>The interface will allow you to select how much you’re boosting the signal with <span class="bold">gain</span> knobs.</p>
